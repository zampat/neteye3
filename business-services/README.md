# Business Logic Enhancements

## Monitoring status aggregation

Enhancement to aggregate the monitoring status of multiple service checks with the same service name. This allows you to aggregate the monitoring states of the same context, i.e., check of Alyvix test case, SQL server status, etc.
(The use case has been introduced on my blog article.](./check_service_aggregator_blog.md)

### Configuration for NetEye 3

2. Import [Monarch Profile: ](./service-profile-monitoring_status_aggregation.xml) 
3. Define services to aggregate using parameter `-s <servicename>`

### Dashboarding
